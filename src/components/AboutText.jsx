          <p>
            I am a developer majored in design specialized in javaScript. My
            strength is front-end: visual elements and building user interfaces,
            but I'm curious enough to look into back-end, or anything involving
            code, really. I like to learn everything and I'll teach myself
            anything. Ideation and people are what gives coding meaning, and for
            that, I'm glad to be a designer too.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a developer, I strive to understand the internals giving
            functionality to a program. I enjoy taking my time to understand
            concepts and challenge myself to learn new languages for fun. To me
            programming is a fun, creative tool drenched in potential to create
            things. It's fulfilling to create something useful, but making the
            ideas in your head come to life (or to code?) is just incredible.

              <p>
                Making and building is the essence of a developer. I'm careful
                with what I build because I understand someone will use it. The
                goal is that someone's experience and that is what I deliver.

              <p>
                I learn the frameworks, practices and languages popular right
                now, fully aware they'll be replaced soon enough. I also invest
                on theory, methodology and on the more permanent knowledge. I'm
                motivated to make useful things and the process is so fun.

              <h3 className="heading3">Design</h3>

              <p>
                Design is taking an abstract idea and planning its realization.
                It's the special first step that makes for a solid beginning.
                Just like in development, design to me is for the people. That's
                why I like front-end, because it's the first layer of contact
                with the user and must be handled skillfully. UI, Web and
                Interaction are my main guns, but I also practice UX and
                Graphical. Actually they depend on one another and sometimes
                function together.

              <h3 className="heading3">People</h3>

              <p>
                I believe it's important to work with stimulating people. In
                college I worked mostly in groups and had good and bad
                experiences. I even lead sometimes. In the end I like to make
                people feel good, be that the users or my work folks.

                the scene closely. Who knows I won't make my first game in the
                near future?
