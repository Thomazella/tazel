            The site is very minimal and simple, trying to leave as much room as
            possible to the artwork. A great deal of emphasis went into making
            something that looked professional and personal at the same time.
            Using the artistâ€™s handwriting helps accomplish that, besides making
            the visitor feel welcomed.

            We decided to show photos of her workplace in the footer, to help
            create a sense of proximity.

            The photo used as header for the homepage is actually a self
            portrait, but an abstract one. Because that was unique, it was
            chosen as a work to derive a color palette from, to be used across
            the site. Transitions and transparencies were a finishing touch used
            to convey a polished experience.

            I worked with other colleagues in college during the design and
            wireframe phase of the project, but the current implementation is
            just me. I work maintaining the project since. @leticia brand, @nina
            grillo, @camila holanda, have you guys seen this new version?
