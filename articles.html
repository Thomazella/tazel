          <p>We all used FTP to upload our sites at some point.
            Nowadays, though, I moved to using rsync and SSH keys, because it's much faster.
            Rsync is a really good file transfer program and SSH is a protocol for secure access to a remote computer.
            Using both together to do the FTP work can save a ton of time, typing and clicking, so I wrote this intro to setting it up.</p>

              <p>The first way I learned to upload  a site over to a server was using FTP. And FTP is good, it has many great free programs out there.
                It's a good way to learn how sites go from local files to being available online.
                It even is easier to relate to other uploads you might have done before, because the interface is familiar.
              </p>
              <p>There are, however, faster ways to get sites live, and to people doing many uploads a day to test things, this saves <em>a lot</em> of time.
                The problem with FTP is that it isn't secure (you could SFTP), it's also slow, and using a graphical computer program is even slower. The dragging and clicking adds to the slowness, and we can automate that, so why not?
                Get rid of typing passwords, too? No, it isn't back breaking to do it. Optionally, it's possible to make things even faster using a shell alias or a script.
                I have one <a class="other-site" href="https://github.com/Thomazella">over at Github.</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                I tried to write a post which explains basic concepts, so someone kinda new to this stuff or just curious about this won't be gaping hopelessly.
                And I think it makes a better post to include explanations, makes me feel like I did a better job.
                If you've used FTP in web development before you're good.
              </p>

              <h3>Ok. What is the command line?</h3>
              <p>It's a tool we'll be using to set this up, and I need to write a post in detail about it later, because the command line is this amazingly useful cool tool (at least I think so.)
                But for now it'll suffice to say a few basics:
              <ul>
                <li>The <em>command line</em> and <em>CLI</em> mean roughly the same thing.</li>
                <li>CLI means <strong>C</strong>ommand <strong>L</strong>ine <strong>I</strong>nterface. Contrast with: <strong>G</strong>raphical <strong>U</strong>ser <strong>I</strong>nterface.</li>
                <li>The<em> terminal</em> is a program where we use the command line, the window.</li>
                <li>We'll be typing commands in a terminal getting some response back from the computer.</li>
                <li>It's not programming and does not require programming knowledge to use.</li>
                <li>Just like anything else, it requires some persistence to pick up.</li>
                <li>Seen as a <code class="inline">h4ck3r</code> thing. It really is not.</li>
                <li>Much faster than a GUI for repetitive work.</li>
                <li>Slower than a GUI for non-repetitive tasks.</li>
              </ul>
              <em class="important">Knowing both allows you to play to their strengths.</em>

              <h3>Shell and scripts?</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Shell</strong> is a type of program that is the heart of the CLI experience, much like windows for a GUI.
                The job of the shell is to understand the commands typed in the terminal.
                We'll use a shell running <strong>Bash</strong>, the most popular shell out there.
                Bash shell scripting is programming a bunch of commands to run together.
                This is actual programming, but not required to upload a site using rsync and ssh.
              </p>

              <h3>What is SSH?</h3>
              <p>It stands for <strong>S</strong>ecure <strong>Sh</strong>ell. It's a connection and security solution to allow access to a remote computer.
                After we set it up, we'll let rsync do the SSH for us. <strong>Rsync</strong> is a really nice file transfer program with multiple uses.
                It can copy files locally on your computer or to another one (our case). It can SSH for us, it's smart and doesn't transfer repeated data, saving time and bandwidth,
                it's resilient and has a million options.
              </p>
              <p><em class="small">so...</em></p>
              <strong class="big">We'll setup SSH access into the web host and upload a site using rsync, then we'll go over some ways reduce our work even further using bash.</strong>

              <h3>Before you begin</h3>
              <h4>Are you on Windows?</h4>
              <p>I'm not keen on Windows support for SSH, rsync and bash, but here are a few ideas:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Windows 10 has SSH <a class="other-site" href="https://www.howtogeek.com/336775/how-to-enable-and-use-windows-10s-built-in-ssh-commands/">on Powershell.</a></li>
                <li>But I guess you would be better off just using the <a class="other-site" href="https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/">Windows Subsystem for Linux.</a></li>
                <li>Not the point here, but I heard <a class="other-site" href="https://putty.org/"> PuTTy</a> is a great GUI for SSH.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Sorry to not support Windows further. The minimum you need on your system is rsync. On Mac and Linux you should have no problems.</p>
              <h4>Do you have FTP upload working already?</h4>
              <p>
                This is important because it means you have a username and password, and a way to get in touch with your web host.
                They usually email you this information right after you purchase the hosting plan.
                You need a web host to log into, obviously.
              </p>

              <h2>Step 1: Making sure SSH works</h2>

              <p>We need to make sure your hosting provider accepts SSH. The pieces of info needed:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Their policy for SSH.</li>
                <li>Port number.</li>
                <li>Username, likely the same used for FTP.</li>
                <li>Servername, likely the same used for FTP.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Each provider may have a different policy in place to allow SSH access, so we'll be googling for it. SSH is known and common in web development so we should find the info right away.
                I'm using namecheap right now, so I googled for:
              </p>
              <div class="container-image-wide"><img class="screenshot" aria-label="screenshot" src="css/img/reads/say-goodbye-ftp/screen-google.png" alt=""></div>
              <p>Try googling for something similar, using your web host in place of mine, obviously. I landed on a knowledge base article with further instructions saying I need to contact support to enable SSH.
                I logged into my account and opened a support ticket saying:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                I would like to access the account using SSH and I am opening a ticket as instructed here:
                https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/1016
              </blockquote>
              <p>They replied in less than 10 minutes with an email:</p>
              <blockquote>

                  We are looking forward to hearing from you.
              </blockquote>
              <p>They even put other info in the email, the server and port. With just this email I was good to go.</p>
              <dl>
                <dt>Their policy for SSH</dt><dd>Authorized</dd>
                <dt>Port number</dt><dd>21098</dd>
                <dt>Username</dt><dd>I was hoping it would be the same.</dd>
                <dt>Servername</dt><dd>server179.web-hosting.com</dd>
              </dl>
              <h3>Using SSH on the terminal</h3>
              <p>With the information, let's SSH. We need a terminal for that. On Linux your terminal name depends on your distro, but is in your programs menu. On MacOS it's called Terminal and is inside Applications <span class="path-arrow"></span> Utilities.</p>
              <p>Heads up:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>All code samples of shell commands are preceded by a <strong>$</strong>.</li>
                <li><em>Don't actually type that!</em></li>
              </ul>
              <em>Type only: cal</em>
              <code class="lang-shell">cal</code>
              <p>Okay, I feel better now. Back to SSH.</p>
              <em>Open your terminal and type:</em>
              <code class="lang-shell">ssh</code>
              <em>Expected output:</em>
              <div class="container-image-wide"><img class="screenshot" aria-label="screenshot" src="css/img/reads/say-goodbye-ftp/screen-ssh.png" alt=""></div>
              <p>This means a SSH program is available and working. Good.</p>
              <em>Notice the prompt?</em>
<pre>
~/Desktop
$
</pre>
              <p>The command we need works like below. Hover or tap on it to show examples of information you could enter. Tap outside to hide.</p>
              <code class="explained lang-shell">ssh -p <span class="explains-syntax" aria-label="port number" data-ex="21098"></span> <span data-ex="heyzor" class="explains-syntax" aria-label="username"></span>@<span data-ex="server179.web-hosting.com" aria-label="servername" class="explains-syntax"></span></code>
              <em>Go ahead and enter the command with your info.</em>
              <p>
                It should say something like 'The authenticity of host ... can't be established.'
                This is normal and will happen the first time connecting to any host.
              </p>
              <em>Type <strong>yes</strong>. Then type your FTP password.</em><br><br>
              <em>Expected output:</em>
              <div class="container-image-wide"><img class="screenshot" aria-label="screenshot" src="css/img/reads/say-goodbye-ftp/screen-prompt.png" alt=""></div>
              <em>Notice the prompt changed?</em>
<pre>
[taz@server179 ~]$
</pre>
              <p>This means it worked and we're <em>logged into the web host</em> and any commands will be executed on the remote computer.
                To test, type <code class="inline lang-shell">ls</code> and it should list the base directory of your hosting storage.
                We're done setting up SSH.
              </p>
              <p>Go ahead and <em>log out</em> with Ctrl + D, this should bring you back to your computer.
                Should login fail, or the program become unresponsive, the kill shortcut is Ctrl + C.
              </p>

              <h3>Having trouble?</h3>
              <p>This is something you need to work with your web hosting provider. If the google search turned up nothing good or just incomplete, I'd just email them or contact support asking something bold like:</p>
              <blockquote>What command do I type in my terminal to SSH into my account?</blockquote>
              <p>That should at worst give you information, and at best the SSH command already figured for you. For problems with SSH you can use a similar approach, or just youtube.</p>

              <h2>Step 2: Skipping the password</h2>

              <p>Let's type passwords the minimum necessary. We have SSH keys.</p>

              <h3>What are SSH keys?</h3>
              <p>A secure, faster authentication method where we don't type passwords.
                It's comprised of a pair of keys, each key being roughly a fingerprint saved to a cryptographed file.
              </p>
              <dl>
                <dt>Public key</dt><dd>It works like a padlock, it's publically visible on the internet.</dd>
                <dt>Private key</dt><dd>The padlock's key, you don't share it with anyone.</dd>
              </dl>
              <p>
                When you try to login, the keys are compared and they must match.
                The only match to your public key is your own private key.
                There are two ways to create the keys:</p>

              <h3>Generating SSH keys yourself</h3>
              <p>This method is faster.</p>
              <em>Type on terminal:</em>
              <code class="lang-shell">ssh-keygen</code>
              <p>It will ask you for one thing at a time, follow the instructions.
                <strong>Leave the save location on default </strong>and give it a password.</p>
              <p>Beware:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Linux - </strong>As far as I know, no way to save the key's password across reboots. The only way to go truly passwordless is to not type a password on <code class="inline">ssh-keygen</code></li>
                <li>The default save path is <code class="inline">~/.ssh</code> which is a hidden directory. Should you browse to it with a file manager, enable hidden files to see it properly.</li>
                <li>The default name for the private key is <code class="inline">id_rsa</code> and public <code class="inline">id_rsa.pub</code>. Should you change the name, change the commands too.</li>
              </ul>
              <dl>
                <dt>Private key default path</dt><dd><code class="inline">~/.ssh/id_rsa</code></dd>
                <dt>Public key default path</dt><dd><code class="inline">~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code></dd>
              </dl>
              <em>Expected output:</em>
              <div class="container-image-wide"><img class="screenshot portrait" aria-label="screenshot" src="css/img/reads/say-goodbye-ftp/screen-keyfinish.png" alt=""></div>
              <p>All good, now we upload the public key to the host keeping the private to ourselves.</p>
              <em>Login at your CPanel, or equivalent software you use to manage your hosting, and look for a SSH menu item.</em>
              <div class="container-image-wide"><img class="screenshot portrait" aria-label="screenshot" src="css/img/reads/say-goodbye-ftp/screen-sshicon.png" alt=""></div>

              <p>It wants you to paste your key in. We'll only be providing the public key, leave the private blank. You can browse to your public key file, open on a text editor and copy it, or copy it with terminal commands.</p>
              <em>MacOS</em>
              <code class="lang-shell">cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy</code>
              <em>Linux</em>
              <code class="lang-shell">cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | xclip -selection c</code>
              <em>Paste it.</em>
              <div class="container-image-wide"><img class="screenshot portrait" aria-label="screenshot" src="css/img/reads/say-goodbye-ftp/screen-importbutton.png" alt=""></div>
              <p>After uploading we need to authorize the key.</p>
              <em>Under public keys, click manage.</em>
              <div class="container-image-wide"><img class="screenshot" aria-label="screenshot" src="css/img/reads/say-goodbye-ftp/screen-manage.png" alt=""></div>
              <em>Click on authorize.</em>
              <p>All done.</p>

              <h3>Generating SSH keys with your host</h3>
              <p>Another way is to do it on the control panel.
                On the SSH menu, choose 'generate a new key', right next to 'import'.</p>
              <em>Fill in the information.</em>
              <div class="container-image-wide"><img class="screenshot portrait" aria-label="screenshot" src="css/img/reads/say-goodbye-ftp/screen-genkeyform.png" alt=""></div>
              <p>You should now have a pair of keys.</p>
              <em>Under private keys, click 'view/download', right next to 'import'. Then 'download key'.</em>
              <div class="container-image-wide"><img class="screenshot portrait" aria-label="screenshot" src="css/img/reads/say-goodbye-ftp/screen-download.png" alt=""></div>
              <p>Private keys stay in our machines and normally live on <code class="inline">~/.ssh</code>.
                So we need to move this new key there.
              </p>
              <em>Move <code class="inline">id_rsa</code> into <code class="inline">~/.ssh</code> using your file manager.</em>
              <p>Or run:</p>
              <code class="explained lang-shell">mv <span class="explains-syntax" aria-label="download location" data-ex="~/Downloads/id_rsa"></span> ~/.ssh/id_rsa</code>
              <p>
                Because the key was downloaded, it might have lost the strict permissions that make it safe.
                To avoid a SSH error, reset the key permissions using:
              </p>
              <code class="lang-shell">chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa</code>

              <h3>Using the key</h3>
              <p>Having authorized the public key on the host and having the private key on <code class="inline">~/.shh</code>, the command becomes:</p>
              <code class="explained lang-shell">ssh -p <span class="explains-syntax" aria-label="port number" data-ex="21098"></span> -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa <span data-ex="heyzor" class="explains-syntax" aria-label="username"></span>@<span data-ex="server179.web-hosting.com" aria-label="servername" class="explains-syntax"></span></code>
              <em>Just add the <code class="inline">-i ~/.ssh/id_rsa</code> bit to the previous command and run it.</em>
              <ul>
                <li>It will ask for <strong>the key's</strong> password, provide it.</li>
                <li><strong>MacOS - </strong>If you get a keychain pop-up, say <strong>y</strong>es to remember the password.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>...you should have logged in! Just like before.
              When you're done log out by hitting Ctrl + D.</p>

              <h3>Saving the key's password</h3>
              <p>We actually just exchanged one password for another... Now we'll save the key's password.
                If your key has a custom name you need to provide its path to the <code class="inline lang-shell">ssh-add</code> command.
              </p>
              <em>Feel free to skip this if concerned with security, typing the password is always safer.</em>
              <h4>Linux</h4>
              <em>Install <code class="inline">keychain</code> if you don't have it.</em>
              <p>Edit <code class="inline">~/.bashrc</code> to add the following line:</p>
              <code>alias loadKeys=‘eval $(keychain -q --eval id_rsa)’</code>
              <em>Open and close your terminal.</em>
              <p>Before using SSH, run <code class="inline lang-shell">loadKeys</code> and type your password.
                It will stay saved until you reboot, even if you log out and log back in.
                If you use SSH a lot, you might add <code class="inline">eval $(keychain -q --eval id_rsa)</code> to bashrc directly,
                but it'll prompt for the password after each boot, as soon as you open a terminal.
              </p>
              <h4>MacOS</h4>
              <p>You must have accepted the keychain pop-up.</p>
              <code class="lang-shell lang-shell">/usr/bin/ssh-add -A</code>
              <h4>Additional step for MacOS versions after Sierra 10.12.2</h4>
              <em>Create a new empty file named <code class="inline">config</code> on <code class="inline">~/.ssh</code>. Copy-paste the following lines:</em>
<pre>
Host *
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
</pre>
              <p>Goodbye passwords. You also don't need to add <code class="inline">-i ~/.ssh/id_rsa</code> to any SSH command anymore and this will persist through reboots.</p>

              <h2>Step 3: Setting up Rsync</h2>

              <p>You definitely already have a version pre-installed on your system.
                A basic rsync command copies <em>source</em> to <em>destination:</em> </p>
              <code class="explained lang-shell">rsync<span data-ex="index.html" class="explains-syntax" aria-label="source"></span> <span data-ex="destination/index.html" aria-label="destination" class="explains-syntax"></span></code>
              <p>You can specify options:</p>
              <code class="explained lang-shell">rsync <span class="explains-syntax" aria-label="options" data-ex=" --links"></span> <span data-ex="index.html" class="explains-syntax" aria-label="source"></span> <span data-ex="destination/index.html" aria-label="destination" class="explains-syntax"></span></code>
              <p>To learn more: <code class="inline lang-shell">man rsync</code>.
                Just know that I wasn't kidding when I said a million.
                We don't need options yet, so leave it blank.
              </p>
              <p>To have rsync SSH for us, we'll need to find the path of your home directory on the web host. This can be as simple as a login into your FTP (here I'm using <a class="other-site" href="https://cyberduck.io/">Cyberduck</a>) and looking at the current directory:</p>
              <div class="container-image-wide"><img class="screenshot" aria-label="screenshot" src="css/img/reads/say-goodbye-ftp/screen-hosthome.png" alt=""></div>
              <em>Or you can SSH into the host and type:</em>
              <code class="lang-shell">pwd</code>
              <p>It will reply to you with the path we're looking for. Let's call this path <code class="inline">hosthome</code>. It probably contains your username on it, something like <code class="inline">/home/heyzor</code> if your username is <code class="inline">heyzor</code>.</p>

              <h3>Testing it</h3>
              <p>Let's test sending something over to the host.</p>
              <em>Find a test file. Example:</em>
              <dl>
                <dt>Filename</dt><dd>foo.txt</dd>
                <dt>Path</dt><dd>~/Desktop/foo.txt</dd>
              </dl>
              <em>Fill in your information and execute:</em>
              <code class="explained lang-shell">rsync
                -e "ssh -p
                <span class="explains-syntax" aria-label="port number" data-ex="21098"></span>"
                <span data-ex="~/Desktop/foo.txt" class="explains-syntax" aria-label="source"></span>
                <span data-ex="heyzor" class="explains-syntax" aria-label="username"></span>@<span data-ex="server179.web-hosting.com" aria-label="servername" class="explains-syntax"></span>:<span data-ex="/home/heyzor" aria-label="hosthome" class="explains-syntax"></span>/<span data-ex="destination/foo.txt" aria-label="destination" class="explains-syntax"></span>
              </code>
              <p>Careful:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Make sure the destination directory exists on the host, either create it or use an existing one. Rsync will give you an error if you use a directory that doesn't exist.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>If you see no output, that's good. Use SSH or your FTP to verify the file arrived on the host.</p>
              <em>Alright!</em>
              <div class="container-image-wide"><img class="screenshot portrait" aria-label="screenshot" src="css/img/reads/say-goodbye-ftp/screen-test.png" alt=""></div>

              <h3>Time for a site upload</h3>
              <p>Rsync can easily send a whole directory to another directory on your host. Yep, the whole site with <code class="inline">css</code> and <code class="inline">js</code> and any other subdirectories you might have, piece of cake.
                To have it work with directories I use roughly these options:</p>
              <dl>
                <dt>--recursive</dt><dd>Send subdirectories along with their contents</dd>
                <dt>--update</dt><dd>Skip files that are newer on the destination</dd>
                <dt>--inplace</dt><dd>Only send new data for modified files</dd>
                <dt>--no-relative</dt><dd>Don't use relative path names</dd>
              </dl>
              <code class="lang-shell">rsync --recursive --update --inplace --no-relative</code>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Caveat: </strong> when telling rsync about directories you want it to send, end their names with a forward slash /
                </li>
              </ul>
              <dl>
                <dt>~/Desktop/test-site</dt><dd>~/Desktop/test-site/</dd>
              </dl>
              <em>Try it:</em>
              <code class="explained lang-shell">
                rsync --recursive --update --inplace --no-relative
                  -e "ssh -p
                  <span class="explains-syntax" aria-label="port number" data-ex="21098"></span>"
                  <span data-ex="~/Desktop/test-site/" class="explains-syntax" aria-label="source"></span>
                  <span data-ex="heyzor" class="explains-syntax" aria-label="username"></span>@<span data-ex="server179.web-hosting.com" aria-label="servername" class="explains-syntax"></span>:<span data-ex="/home/heyzor" aria-label="hosthome" class="explains-syntax"></span>/<span data-ex="destination/test-site/" aria-label="destination" class="explains-syntax"></span>
              </code>
              <p>Okay. By now, you should be either sold on this, or not even reading anymore.
                If you chose a directory on the host actually linked to a domain, <em>you just uploaded a site.</em>
              </p>
              <p>It should be live. Isn't that cool? Fast?</p>
              <p>I get it, it might look complicated, but hey, once it's figured out:</p>
              <em class="important">Just copy-paste it over and over.</em>
              <p>Or do even better:</p>

              <h2>step 4: Optimize with bash</h2>

              <p>I think the bare minimum is to alias the rsync command to something smaller. That way we can type <code class="inline lang-shell">uploadSite</code>, and it uploads the site!</p>
              <em>To create an alias use:</em>
              <code class="explained lang-shell">alias
                <span class="explains-syntax" aria-label="alias name" data-ex="foo"></span>="<span class="explains-syntax" aria-label="command" data-ex="echo this is an alias"></span>"
              </code>
              <p>Then type <em>foo</em> to run <code class="inline lang-shell">echo this is an alias</code> </p>
              <em>Should you want to remove an alias:</em>
              <code class="explained lang-shell">unalias <span class="explains-syntax" data-ex="foo" aria-label="alias name"></span></code>
              <p>To make the alias permanent we must add it to one of the shell config files, like <code class="inline">~/.bashrc</code>.</p>
              <p><em>Open <code class="inline">~/.bashrc</code> in a text editor.</em></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>MacOS - </strong>You may use <code class="inline">~/.bash_profile</code> if you have no <code class="inline">~/.bashrc</code>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <em>Add the alias line to the file:</em>
              <code class="lang-shell">alias uploadSite="rsync --recursive --update --inplace --no-relative -e "ssh -p 21098" ~/Desktop/test-site/ heyzor@server179.web-hosting.com:/home/heyzor/destination/test-site/"</code>
              <p>To cause the shell to read the file, it needs to restart. To do that you can restart the terminal, or switch to a new tab.</p>
              <p><em>And that's it.</em></p>

              <h3>A function</h3>
              <p>The alias is simple and great, but you would have to edit that line on your shell file everytime you change the site you want to upload, because the source and destination directories are hardcoded.</p>
              <p>Here's a trivial function to deal with that problem:</p>
<pre>
uploadSite() {
  #this function takes 2 parameters
  #1 - source directory
  #2 - destination directory
  #source is sent to destination via rsync SSH

  #check enough arguments were provided
  if [ "$1" == "" -o "$2" == "" ]; then
    echo "Please provide two arguments"
    echo "1 - source directory"
    echo "2 - destination directory"
    echo "source is sent to destination via rsync SSH"
    return
  fi

  #rsync call
  rsync --recursive --update --inplace --no-relative -e "ssh -p 21098" "$1" heyzor@server179.web-hosting.com:/home/heyzor/"$2"/
}</pre>
              <p>It essentially just checks if you passed it non-empty names, and substitutes them into the rsync command. Please make sure the names you pass as arguments are valid!
                Paste it on your init file, then restart the shell.
              </p>
              <em>Use like this:</em>
              <code class="explained lang-shell">uploadSite <span class="explains-syntax" data-ex="~/Desktop/test-site" aria-label="source"></span> <span class="explains-syntax" data-ex="destination/test-site" aria-label="destination"></span></code>

              <h3>My own function</h3>
              <p>I have my own function for doing this on <a href="https://github.com/Thomazella">Github</a>. It's slightly easier to use because it figures out the directory names for you, but you need to use the same names on both your computer and the host.</p>
              <em>That's my first post, I hope it's useful!</em>

              <p>Is a site trying to do the right thing about the problem of password dumps.
                In a nutshell, hackers 0wn a site, and post the data they obtained online, for anyone to use or see.
                This is a bit hard to imagine, <em>wouldn't they sell it instead?</em> Well, haveibeenpwned numbers show that only 1% of the hacked data is pasted publically,
                and just that 1% is a big problem already.
              </p>
              <p>
              You can use haveibeenpwned to check if your email appears in any public dump, and change your password before someone uses it.
              It also means haveibeenpwned has a copy of the password dump... Think about that, it's at least uncomfortable to imagine.
              Running a site keeping a copy of stolen data? But after reading the story of the site, I'm convinced people have done worse,
              like putting up the dump behind a pay wall. Turns out the site is run by a security guy, and he seems to have a good reputation and has been receiving the right
              attention for haveibeenpwned, and that's good.

              Because the data has been dumped in the wild, actually collecting it and doing something good is the best course of action.
              Think about it, after being initially posted, the data will be quickly replicated, since many people will copy it immediately,
              and all these people are independent from one another. That means once it's out there, there's no going back.

              This modern habit of hackers has given rise to a new cyber crime, credential stuffing.
